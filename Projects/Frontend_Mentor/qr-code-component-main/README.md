## My process

### Built with

- basic HTML
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used this bit of css to center the card vertically and horizontally on the webpage.

```css
	.info_card {
		margin: 0;
		position: absolute;
		top: 50%;
		left: 50%;
		-ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
		transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
	}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to work on making my websites more accessable on multiple devices and browsers. I'm not to familiar with all the nuances and best practices for styling for different devices and browsers.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with getting the basics of html and css.
